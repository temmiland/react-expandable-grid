 * stories when using `composeStories` or `composeStory`.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * // setup-file.js
 * import { setProjectAnnotations } from '@storybook/react';
 * import projectAnnotations from './.storybook/preview';
 *
 * setProjectAnnotations(projectAnnotations);
 * ```

 * @param componentAnnotations - E.g. (import Meta from './Button.stories')
 * @param [projectAnnotations] - E.g. (import * as projectAnnotations from '../.storybook/preview')

 * @param [exportsName] - In case your story does not contain a name and you want it to have a name.
